# Capstone-DT
This is my capstone code-Experimental study of Constant-work-space algorithms for triangulating a planar pointset
//constant.py -> Used to implement the constant workspace method
//incremental.py-> Used to implement the incremental method
//test.py-> Used to draw the result and show the running time and memory usage
//data_analysis.py-> Used to analysis the result and try to fit the function
